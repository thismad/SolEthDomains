# EthSolDomains
Is a data analysis tool to analyze ENS sales and find its Sol domain equivalents (SNS).
The goal is to find the best potential ROI for SNS domains to buy.

I use the following data sources:
- Reservoir API (Eth aggregator) : To get all sales on the ENS collection from all the different NFT marketplaces
- MagicEden (Solana marketplace) : To get all listed SNS domains
- QuickNode (Solana node service) : To find if a SNS domain is still available for registration
- Bitmex API (Solana prices) : Get solana prices at the time of the listing
